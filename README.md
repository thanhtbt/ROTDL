# ROTDL: Robust Online Tucker Dictionary Learning from Multidimensional Data Streams

We propose a novel online algorithm called ROTDL for the problem of robust tensor tracking under the Tucker format.
ROTDL is not only capable of tracking the underlying Tucker dictionary of multidimensional data streams over time, but also
robust to sparse outliers. The proposed algorithm is specifically designed by using the alternating direction method of multipliers,
block-coordinate descent, and recursive least-squares filtering techniques.
